## Overview

This repository contains the practical artifact for the Bachelor thesis
**“Visualizing Neural Network Decision Processes in Unity – An Interactive Approach to Explainable AI.”**

The project investigates how **Explainable AI (XAI)** concepts can be communicated through **interactive visualization** and **gamified exploration** using the **Unity Engine**.
It translates abstract neural-network logic—weights, activations, losses, and optimizers—into an engaging, hands-on learning experience for non-experts.

## Research Question

> **How can Unity-based interactive visualization and gamification make neural-network decision processes more transparent and understandable for non-expert users?**

---

## Key Objectives

1. **Visualize** neural-network computations (2 → 3 → 1 MLP) as dynamic decision fields.
2. **Integrate gamification** through missions, feedback, and progression loops.
3. **Quantify faithfulness** between visualization and real model behavior using a perturbation-based F-score.
4. **Evaluate usability** and educational impact in a small exploratory user study.

---

## Architecture

**Model Layer (Python)**

* Train small MLPs on synthetic datasets (`blobs`, `moons`, `rings`).
* Export weights, biases, and activations as JSON.

**Visualization Layer (Unity 6 LTS)**

* 2D/URP interactive scenes built in C#.
* Unified UI (Canvas + Mission Panel + Metric Panel).
* Six core scenes + two experimental extensions:

| Scene | Concept                       | Focus                                    |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| S1    | Backpropagation Explorer      | Visualize gradient flow & weight updates |
| S2    | Optimizers Playground         | Compare SGD, Momentum, Adam trajectories |
| S3    | Activation Functions Explorer | Show non-linear decision boundaries      |
| S4    | Loss & Thresholds             | Tune loss functions and decision cutoffs |
| S5    | Capacity & Regularization     | Visualize overfitting vs generalization  |
| S6    | Attribution & Saliency        | Input feature importance                 |
| S7    | Counterfactual Exploration    | Prototype (what-if analysis)             |
| S8    | Data Geometry & Complexity    | Prototype (dataset manifolds)            |

**Evaluation Layer**

* `EvalLogger` – records accuracy, loss, faithfulness (F).
* `EventLogger` – captures interactions and objectives.
* `CrossSceneComparison` – aggregates results for reproducibility.

## Evaluation Results

| Metric                 | Mean Value                | Comment                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Faithfulness (F-score) | ≈ 0.89 ± 0.02             | Strong correlation between visual and computed outputs |
| User Study (n = 5)     | Educational Value 4.8 / 5 | High clarity and motivation ratings                    |
| Scenes Tested          | S1 & S3                   | Both achieved stable runtime and positive feedback     |

Participants described the experience as *“learning through play”* and confirmed that visual feedback improved conceptual understanding of neural-network behavior.
